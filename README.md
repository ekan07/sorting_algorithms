# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Description
This project is a partner project part of the curriculum of Holberton School.
Its aim is to explore, learn and implement most well-known sorting algorithms.
It's also about understanding the Big O notation of time complexity.
These algorithms are implemented in C.
